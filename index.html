      <h3>Investment</h3>
      <p>Our investment portfolio is built neither to minimize risk nor to maximize returns but to perform well in all market conditions and provide superior returns consistently. We call it the “weather” approach to investing (a phrase coined and popularized by Ray Dalio).</p>
